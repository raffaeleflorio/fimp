# FIMP

FIMP (**F**inding **I**s **M**y **P**urpose) is an in-memory search engine written in Java for fun.

It's written with object-oriented principles in mind, and it has no dependencies. This means, you can integrate it
easily in any Java project.

# REST interface

A REST interface is available [in this Quarkus project](TODO)
